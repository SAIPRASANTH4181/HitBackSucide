<H2> Hit-Back Suicide: An Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on Suicide Notes and Prevention </H2>

According to the Suicide Awareness Voice of Education (SAVE) organization on an average nearly 800000 people commit suicide every year implies one death for every 40 seconds. According to study depression is the primary source for the suicidal thoughts. Moreover, suicide is the 2nd death reason for the age group people between 15-24 years. It is very pathetic to know that the adults and young people are ending their lifeâ€™s half the journey to the destination. There is big research gap for analyzing the emotional reasons for suicidal thoughts. There has already been study that took into consideration the suicidal note and analyzed the victim behavior. But this becomes the major drawback. Because, once after person is death there is no point of analyzing the suicidal note. So, the present proposed paper will help in analyzing the comments and reviews of the social media user. In the present proposal we are extracting the tweets based on keyword suicide. And then follow the Sentic based analysis and compare it with aspect-based analysis. Finally, we will come up with world-cloud representation of the aspects that result in suicide. By doing this we may come to know the user reaction well in advance and avoid them from committing suicide. The early detection of suicidal thoughts is better than later investigation.
The objective of the project is to analyze the suicidal aspect and sentiment score through the twitter data. For current project we will be using the twitter scrapped data, the same data can be replaced by the case details by our stake holders to solve the case. Users must upload the file that contains recent social media scrapped data through the UI. The system will analyze the data and presents the sentiment score along with the word cloud that tells what are the aspects that are being considered for the sentiment score and which effected the victim.
